# Omnideck API
This is the package for the Unity Omnitrack API by Omnifinity.

## Installation
Use the Unity Package Manager and add this github repo using the 
url. 

Navigate to the <i>Project Settings > XR Plug-in Managment</i>. Enable the OpenXR tickbox and fix any issues Unity recommends.
If you are using a HTC Vive Controller navigate to the <i>Project Settings > XR Plug-in Management > OpenXR</i> and add the <i>HTC Vive Controller Profile</i> in the <i>Interaction Profiles</i> section.

## Samples
The package contains two simple samples that integrate the Omnideck API with a unity Gameobject.
- Example 1: The Omnideck Platform uses Unity Character Controller that can collide with the surrounding objects. It has an XR Rig attached to it.
- Example 2: The Omnideck Platform uses a Vector3 script, without any object collision. It has an XR Rig attached to it.
